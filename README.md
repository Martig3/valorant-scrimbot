# valorant-scrimbot

Simple Discord bot for managing & organizing a queue for 10 man scrims in Valorant

## Features
Manages a 10 person queue, then starts a map vote followed by a draft. 
At the end of the setup, it prints out everyone's RiotId to help facilitate joining a custom lobby.
### Example Screenshots

## Setup

No CI/CD yet so clone the repo, create a `config.yaml` file (see example below) and run using standard `cargo run`

**Note:** Make sure to only allow the bot to listen/read messages in one channel only. 
### Example config.yaml

```yaml
autoclear_hour: <value between 0-24> -- optional
post-setup-msg: GLHF! Add any string here -- optional
discord:
  token: <your discord bot api token>
  admin_role_id: <a discord server role id> -- optional, but highly recommended!!!
  team_a_channel_id: <a discord channel id> -- optional
  team_b_channel_id: <a discord channel id> -- optional
```
